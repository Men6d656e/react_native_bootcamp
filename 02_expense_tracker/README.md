# 💰 Expense Tracker (Full-Stack Monorepo)

Welcome to the Expense Tracker project. This repository is structured as a monorepo, separating the server-side logic from the mobile application interface.

## 📂 Project Structure

To get started, please visit the dedicated documentation in each subfolder:

* **[Backend (Node.js/Express)](./backend/README.md)**: Contains the API logic, database configuration (Supabase/PostgreSQL), and deployment instructions for Render.
* **[Mobile (React Native/Expo)](./mobile/README.md)**: Contains the frontend code, Clerk authentication setup, and EAS Build (APK) configuration.

### 🚀 Quick Start
1.  **Backend First:** Set up and deploy your backend server following the guide in the `/backend` folder.
2.  **Mobile Second:** Connect your mobile app to your live backend URL and configure your Clerk environment variables in the `/mobile` folder.

> **Note:** Every folder in this project contains its own `README.md` with specific installation and environment setup instructions. Please read them carefully to ensure the app runs correctly.
