# Twitter Clone (Full Stack)

This is the **4th Project** of my React Native Bootcamp. It is a full-featured social media application built with a modern mobile stack, featuring a dedicated Express backend and an Expo-based mobile frontend.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main parts:

* **`/mobile`**: The React Native (Expo) frontend application.
* **`/backend`**: The Express.js server and MongoDB database logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, please follow the specific setup instructions in each directory:

1. Navigate to the **[Backend README](https://www.google.com/search?q=./backend/README.md)** to set up your server, database, and environment variables.
2. Navigate to the **[Mobile README](https://www.google.com/search?q=./mobile/README.md)** to set up the Expo environment and start the app on your device or emulator.

## 📦 Try the App

If you want to test the application without setting up the full development environment:
