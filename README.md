# 📱 React Native Bootcamp Series

This repository documents my progression from **Web Development to Mobile Development**. It contains 6 full-stack projects built during my React Native bootcamp, moving from foundational concepts to complex real-time architectures.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into 6 distinct milestones. Each folder contains a **dedicated README** with specific technical details, environment setup, and backend documentation.

## 🚀 Deployment & Usage

* **Releases:** For each project, you can find a pre-compiled **Android APK** in the GitHub Releases section.
* **Setup:** To run these projects locally, navigate into the specific project folder and follow the instructions in the local `README.md`.

> [!NOTE]
> Projects 04, 05, and 06 use hosted cloud resources (Clerk, MongoDB, Neon, Convex). These demo services are maintained for **3 months** post-release. To use the code after this period, you must configure your own infrastructure keys.

## 🎯 The Journey

This series served as a comprehensive "warm-up" to the mobile development lifecycle. I have explored:

* **Authentication:** Clerk (Social & Email)
* **Databases:** NoSQL (MongoDB), Relational (PostgreSQL), and Serverless (Convex).
* **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS) and StyleSheet.
* **State Management:** TanStack Query and reactive subscriptions.
